# BST-Website
Contains all code for the site hosted at bstonline.org.
## Code Structure
Tries to emulate a MVC-style framework to be able to generate views. All display UI exists in the TS layer.

*navigate.ts* will take to you the various views
*views/home/homeView.ts* renders the home page
*views/show/showView.ts* renders the show page
